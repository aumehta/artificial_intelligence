# Artificial Intelligence 
This repository contains my personal AI projects. The source code is written in Java and Python. 

## AI-based Implementations:

**Eight-Puzzle Solver:** The source code for an algorithm designed to solve the Eight-Puzzle, providing both the interactive game aspect and the solving algorithm. It utilizes the A* search algorithm and k-states beam search, implemented in Java.

**Iris Species Classifier:** The Python source code for classifying Iris flowers based on their petal/sepal dimensions. The code encompasses the following topics:
1. **Unsupervised Learning:** Utilizing KMeans clustering to identify Iris species.
2. **Linear Decision Boundaries:** Plots the decision boundaries for non-linearity.
3. **Neural Network:** Creating a Neural Network employing logistic regression to classify Iris species, with optimization of neural network weights through gradient descent.
4. **Multi-Layer Perceptron:** Leveraging Scikit-learn's Multi-Layer Perceptron for classifying various Iris classes.
5. **Exploring Various Non-Linearities:** Observed the impact of various non-linearities on the overall result of the algorithm.
